Square9 Audit Log Analytics
=================

Square-9's hacker hours club is proud to present our SmartSearch Audit Log API. With this API we provide a ReSTful interface into SmartSearch's audit logging database, allowing the manipulation and display of data based on SmartSearch activity and User.

Included with the project is a small sample UI, built on top of c3.js (http://c3js.org), and using Dan Grossman's Date Range Picker (https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker).
